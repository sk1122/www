## Why me?

Why am I telling you this? Who am I? Am I already in Web3?

You should know who I am if you are reading this ;)

## Why are we calling it Web3?

Web3 just doesn't sounds right, it sounds like a scam, a ponzi scheme. Also it makes it different than web2 which it is not, web3 is just an extension of already existing web and we should keep it like that. We aren't even changing the current systems yet we are portraying as if we are changing something and in the end just confusing everybody.
