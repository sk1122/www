### Little background about me

As you might know, I am Satyam, a internet taught computer programmer with an heavy interest in blockchain and deep tech. I come from a typical marathi middle class family, my whole family (except my parents) work for government mostly in education dept. As my parents werent government employees and decided to do something of their own and because of some circumstances we were very poor than rest of our family members and growing up it didn't bother me except for a few moments, but my parents were expecting me to be a government employee, I didn't wanted to be a government employee, I used to listed to stories of Mark zuckerberg and Bill gates and got inspired by them decided to do something in tech industry

It was 2016, at the height of *Indian Tech Youtube Boom* and I decided to start my own youtube channel, made 50+ videos explaining new mobiles, laptops, games and other tech devices, at the same time my mother used to take computer classes, she was learning HTML, CSS and DTP. One day, I took her HTML notes and decided to build a website for my youtube channel, I was successful but didn't knew we also need to host to show it to others ;)

After about 2 years, I finished 10th, decided to ditch the +2 route and opted for +3 route which gave me more free time to self learn programming and hell I did that, created a lot of projects in ML, Web Dev, took various internships and decided to get into fulltime into web3 at around January.

In web3, I built various projects with some awesome people (same people I am building Fetcch (Prev WagPay) with), won various grants, decided to take an internship, but never stopped building at nights and weekends, I was about to be converted to full time but I decided to left that opportunity, I decided to build and grow WagPay (Now Fetcch)

### But why did I chose to build WagPay (Now Fetcch), even though my bank balance was drying up and I had bills to pay?

Its interesting question because I also don't know the answer to it

- *It can be the tech, as cross chain and blockchain UX is space which I have been studying since my day 1 in blockchain*
- *It can be the opportunity to build something which might be used by billions*
- *It can just be money (Which I don't have yetðŸ˜­ðŸ˜‚)*

## What is Fetcch (Prev WagPay)?

I have ranted a lot about things that are not related, but let's get to the point **What the fuck is Fetcch?**

**Fetcch's main goal is to solve blockchain's ux problems**

*We not building sleek UIs and claiming to have solved UX*

How are we solving Blockchain UX?

Main problem in onboarding people to web3 is ***choice fatigue***

Choice Fatigue is a real problem in web3 and it is hurting the onboarding of normal web2 users, there are just so many things to choose from

We have 10+ blockchain, 100+ Wallets to choose from, every wallet and dApp support different blockchain

![Wallet options while connecting to a dApp](https://i.ibb.co/fXwH8mF/blocknative.png)

*Wallet options while connecting to a dApp (there are more...)*

Then there are wallet addresses 
- they are big
- they are random

Many naive people have send tokens to wrong addresses or sent the wrong address, because addresses and a big blob of random text, its very hard to memorize and you always need to copy from somewhere, which is a actual bummer!!

Any other reason like low TPS, frequent hacks is just pure bullshit

- There exists blockchains like Solana with High TPS and L2 solutions like Polygon with High TPS and closer to Ethereum
- Hacks are a reason of poor security practices and buggy code, which can be fixed in future cycles

So to summarize these are the 2 main problems stopping the mass adoption of web3

- Choice Fatigue
- Addresses


At Fetcch, we are trying to solve this 2 problems

We are building suite of protocols which will solve both problems while increasing the Blockchain UX

### We are building a Bridge

As unassuming it sounds, its quite interesting, its not just another bridge but we are enabling swapping any token to any token directly at the bridge level with better managed liquidity pools and increased security.

This will be the first step taken to solve Choice Fatigue, it will interconnect many blockchains and just make it buttery smooth to move from Chain A to Chain B.

We will manage liquidity pools of stables on every chain, it will be self rebalancing and then using DEX aggregators we can swap from any token to any token with lesser overall fees and time taken.

This will solve

- Choice Fatigue
  - User can access smart contracts on Chain B from Chain A
    - Still user needs to manually swap and execute the call

### We are building an ID Protocol

We are building a Cross Chain, Composable Wallet ID Protocol
